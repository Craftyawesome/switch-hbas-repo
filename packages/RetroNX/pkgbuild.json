        "details": "Notice: This is a fairly large package, so it may take some time to download! Therefore, in order to keep file sizes down, this package contains only six cores: melonds, mgba, gambatte, mupen64plus_next, snes9x, and nestopia. For other cores, use the built-in Online Updater. For more themes, use the built-in Online Updater.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you are seeing asset/icon issues with your theme, try: Main menu -> online updater -> update assets, and restarting.\\n\\nCourtesy of m4xw\\n----------------------------------------------------\\nFor more information regarding RetroArch, the location/names of BIOS files, and compatibility with ROMs, please refer to the official Libretro documentation at:\\nhttps://docs.libretro.com/\\nUse the sidebar under \"Core Documentation\" to read more about the core you're looking for.\\n\\nF.A.Q.\\n\\nQ: My Switch has crashed/softlocked, and RetroArch doesn't work properly!\\nA: First, make sure you are on a Horizon OS version (I.E. Nintendo's Switch OS) higher than 1.0.0. Second, no matter which firmware you are on, ALWAYS FORMAT YOUR SD CARD AS FAT32; NO EXCEPTIONS. If you continue to use RetroNX under the ExFAT filesystem, we cannot provide additional support beyond the previously elaborated-upon disclaimer.\\n\\nQ: I'm trying to save changes to the settings, but it doesn't commit!\\nA: Save the current configuration with no content loaded. You can do this from any core.\\n\\nQ: My question is not listed here/where can I go for additional support?\\nA: The fastest method for support and staying up-to-date on progress for RetroNX, you can join the Discord server with the following link:\\n  https://discord.gg/jTmfAEx\\nWhen you are posting about issues related to the cores (assuming you have read through this readme and identified your problem is uncommon/unrelated to the above), please list the following pieces of information in your report alongside the issue:\\n - Horizon OS version (I.E. Switch OS firmware version)\\n - Core used\\n - Whether core used is a Master/Stable or Nightly/Unstable; what is the builddate of said core?\\n - Version of the Hekate payload used\\nMake sure to post in the channel listed #retroarch-homebrew.\\n----------------------------------------------------\\nCredits:\\nm4wx - Primary developer of RetroNX/Libretro-NX.\\nlifajucejo, others - Supporting developers/contributers to the RetroNX project.\\nSwitchbrew - Developers/contributors for the LibNX project and API which RetroNX is built on.\\nOriginal Libretro Team - Primary developer of the Libretro/RetroArch project that RetroNX is built upon.\\nAll the testers and users that report notable issues.\\nAn Average Seong - Packaging the build in a convenient pack/writer of the very README you're reading!

The value now toggles directly, just like boolean options everywhere else in the menu\\nCORE OPTIONS: Toggling an option that changes the number of core options being displayed (i.e. things like `Show Advanced Audio/Video Settings) no longer resets the navigation pointer to the start of the list\\nCORE OPTIONS: Before, RetroArch would identify core option values as being \u2018boolean\u2019 if they had labels matching the specific strings enabled or disabled. Most core devs would abide by this, but not always\u2026 As a result, we sometimes would end up with misidentified values, with all kinds of Enabled, Off, True, etc. strings littering the menu, in place of proper toggle switches. All boolean-type value labels are now detected, and replaced with standard ON/OFF strings.\\nCRT: On the fly CRT porch adjuments \u2013 these changes allow a user to adjust how the porch algorithm generates the 15khz/31khz output.

This means we can now view bios info etc. - and more importantly delete cores - without jumping through all the hoops of loading a core first and navigating all over the place\\nCORE DOWNLOADER/UPDATER: Add option to automatically backup cores when updating\\nINPUT: Added a hotkey delay option to allow hotkey input to work properly when it is assigned to another action\\nINPUT: Remove 'All Users Control Menu' setting, was buggy and will be properly reintroduced after input overhaul\\nLOCALIZATION: Add Persian language\\nLOCALIZATION: Add Hebrew language\\nLOCALIZATION: Add Asturian language\\nMENU: Proper line wrapping for message dialog boxes\\nMENU/HOTKEYS: Add sublabels to all hotkey bind entries\\nMENU/QUICK MENU: Suppress the display of 'empty' quick menu listings when closing content\\nMENU/OZONE: Performance improvements\\n\\n1.8.5\\n\\nhttps://www.libretro.com/index.php/retroarch-1-8-5-released/\\n\\n1.8.4\\n\\nLIBNX/SWITCH: Updated libnx integration to v3.0.0. This also cherry-picks libnx commit 583d6bb92dcbb33b6bb4a0fa1a9df6e3725d6ef6, which should fix the requirement having to turn rumble off and on in the system settings once per reboot\\n\\n\\n1.8.3\\n\\nSWITCH/LIBNX/BUGFIX: Fix onscreen keyboard input regression\\n (XMB/OZONE) Fix quick menu detection.
