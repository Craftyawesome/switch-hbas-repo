        "details": "\"Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers\" is a Technical Kart Racer, drawing inspiration from \"antigrav\" racers, fighting games, and traditional-style kart racing.\\n\\nDesigned to minimize randomness and emphasize player expression, Ring Racers isn't just about precise handling--you'll need to master tense combat, resource management, and taking risks under pressure.\\n\\nRing Racers is not a \"pick-up-and-play\" experience. If you aren't already a racing fanatic, the learning curve will be quite steep.\\n\\nIt takes a while to boot up, longer than SRB2/kart do. Increase the CPU clock with something like sys-clk. It helps framerates significantly, which is needed to get modes with multiple racers to a playable framerate. Legacy GL is not very stable, especially with multiple racers. Consider using software only. I would recommend a resolution of 708x400 under software, and 800x450 for less complex tracks or one racer. Legacy GL can handle larger at similar framerates. Buttons match the Xbox controller layout."
